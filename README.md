# C-Codebase
My honest atempt of making a good C code base that is useful and intuitive to my future projects.

The name of the header is 'libft.h' just because is more convinient, i study at 42 so...
If you want to use this codebase, just copy the 'libft' folder to your project and include the header in your files.

I will try my best to keep organized and readable for everyone who wants to use it, study with it or just take a look.

I will be updating this codebase as i learn more and more about C, so stay tuned for more updates.

first I started this because 42 school dont allow(for the most time) using external functions, so i had to make my own functions to do the job. this is why you will see a lot of functions that are already implemented in the standard library.
